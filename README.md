# BioPython-NucleicAcid-PCRDesign
Biopython Nucleic Acid mutation diagnosis and PCR primer design README

The main part of program imports bio python to organize the sequence input and have its own pcr primer design program to work together.

How to install the bio python:

You can use the command line and pip function to type “pip install biopython”. The pip will install the biopython for you. Some programs you might install first such as windows visual studio.

User interface of the program:

The user interface is very simple. It takes a Q and A mode to complete its functions.
First you give an input an original type sequence file name which you want to set a formal sample.
Second you set a pcr product length between 200 to 500 as pcr works better in this range.
The program will filter many group samples to select.
Third you input the specific position to the whole sequence.
The program will filter those just generated selections to this spot.
If there is no filtered result, the program will allow you to input a different length again.
Then you can input the specific position again to get the start and end point of pcr product.
In a lab we pretend to run pcr chemical reaction and get the original and mutated pcr product from the designed primer from above.
Final you give the input of the mutated pcr result sequence file to compare.
The program will automatically analyze the single or multiple points mutated position and present the change from the original type of code and amino acid to the mutated type of code and amino acid.
